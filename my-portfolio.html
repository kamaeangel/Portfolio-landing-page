        <p>The reason I chose to study at Moringa School is because there is nothing more satisfying to me than solving a problem.
            Thus, I will be happy to <strong>provide solutions</strong> to user's problems. With a backgound in Art, I want to incorporate my creativity
            with systems and functionality. Being new to coding, Moringa will provide me with the ability to <strong>learn new programming languages</strong> learn,
            and adapt to the continually changing environment.
