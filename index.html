        <h2>Why Moringa School</h2>
        <p>The reason I chose to study at Moringa School is because there is nothing more satisfying to me than solving a problem.
            Thus, I will be happy to provide solutions to user's problems. With a backgound in Art, I want to incorporate my creativity
            with systems and functionality. Being new to coding, Moringa will provide me with the ability to learn new programming languages,
            and adapt to the continually changing environment.
